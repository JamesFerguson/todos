Step: 5m - 30m chunk of continguous work; "tune guitar", "get music", "look up demo on YT", "play chords through", "try rythm"
Task: 30m - 8hr logical unit of work; "practice once"
Objective: 1 - 4 days of concerted effort; "be able to play 'Elderly Woman' through"
Project: finite but long lived work effort; "learn to play 10 songs"
Theme (Epic): a goal, value or wish without limits or concrete definition; "learn guitar"

Context: a circumstance that's required for a task to get done; "personal time"

User: an owner of work items
Sock Puppet: used to model someone who isn't using the system holding a work item when the user has to followup; the user 
  still owns the item, this just visualizes what's happening to it; it is a prerequisite that the person the puppet 
  represents has been informed that they own the task.
User Group: work items can only be passed within a user group; "<workplace>", "family"

Value (?): cash you would pay (if you could) to have the work item done instantly, in some cases the estimated future
  time/cost saved by completing the work item - if you estimate the dollar value of your time, the value of a work item 
  and estimated time required for the item allow you to compare Cost/Benefit and identify
